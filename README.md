# 🧠 MRI Brain Tumor Detection App

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload MRI brain images and receive diagnostic predictions using deep learning. The app supports both binary (tumor / no tumor) and multiclass (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor) classification using pretrained CNN models.
