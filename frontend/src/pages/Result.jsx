      "A glioma is a type of brain tumor that originates in the glial cells, which are the supportive cells of the brain and spinal cord. These tumors are typically cancerous and can be either slow-growing (low-grade) or fast-growing (high-grade). Common types of gliomas include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas",
    bullets: [
      "Grades:\n\n Gliomas are graded based on how aggressive they are, ranging from Grade 1 (least aggressive) to Grade 4 (most aggressive).",
      "Symptoms: \n\n Symptoms can vary depending on the size, location, and grade of the glioma but may include headaches, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and neurological deficits like weakness or numbness.",
      "Treatment: \n\n Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the tumor's type, grade, and location."

    title: "ðŸ§  Tumor Type: Meningioma",
    description:
      "A meningioma is a tumor that develops from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. These tumors are usually benign and slow-growing, but they can cause problems if they grow large enough to put pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or surrounding tissues. Meningiomas are classified into three grades (I, II, and III), with higher grades indicating more aggressive growth",
    bullets: [
      "Grades:\n\n Meningiomas are graded on a scale of 1 to 3, with Grade 1 being benign, Grade 2 being atypical, and Grade 3 being malignant.",
      "Symptoms: \n\n Meningiomas can cause a range of symptoms depending on their size and location, including headaches, vision problems, seizures, and neurological deficits.",
      "Treatment: \n\n Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and other therapies, depending on the tumor's grade, location, and size."

  "Pituitary": {
    title: "ðŸ§  Tumor Type: Pituitary",
    description:
      "A pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain. Most pituitary tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and do not spread to other parts of the body. However, they can disrupt normal pituitary function, leading to hormonal imbalances and various symptoms.",
    bullets: [
      "Benign vs. Malignant: \n\n Most pituitary tumors are benign, meaning they don't spread to other parts of the body.",
      "Hormonal Imbalances: \n\n Pituitary tumors can cause the pituitary gland to produce too many or too few hormones, leading to a variety of symptoms.",
      "Symptoms: \n\n Symptoms can vary depending on the tumor's size and the hormone imbalances it causes. Common symptoms include headaches; Eye problems due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision; Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain; Drooping eyelid; Seizures; Nausea and vomiting; Fatigue; and changes in hormone-related functions (e.g., menstrual cycle, sexual function, growth)."
